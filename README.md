# Crypto Jeopardy

## Decentralized Dilemmas: A Blockchain Jeopardy Challenge
The practice of securing communication by transforming plaintext into unreadable ciphertext, and vice versa, using mathematical algorithms and secret keys...What is Cryptography?

## Introduction
So… Let’s talk about the exciting world of Cryptography, demystify the belief of its complexity, build on fundamental knowledge and challenge you to learn more about the fundamental, objectives, uses, methods and even humor regarding cryptography.  How about we make a game of it and test your knowledge as you attempt to gain the highest score, in a game of Jeopardy. Each round will have category specific questions in the form of statements and answers required in the form of questions. Are you up for the challenge? What if we make it even more interesting and specialize the game to see how much you know about blockchains? 

## Blockchain Of Trust

So why did we select blockchain as the specialty topic for our Jeopardy game? Blockchain technology is a revolutionary new way of storing and transferring data that is quickly gaining traction in a wide range of industries. At its core, blockchain combines cryptographic techniques and a decentralized architecture to provide three key features: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA Triad). 

Confidentiality is maintained through the use of public-key cryptography. Each participant in the blockchain network has a unique pair of keys, one public and one private. The public key is used to encrypt data, while the private key is used to decrypt it. This ensures that only authorized parties can access the information stored on the blockchain.

Integrity is maintained by using a hash function to create a unique digital fingerprint of each block in the chain. This fingerprint, or hash, is based on the data contained in the block and the hash of the previous block in the chain. This creates a tamper-evident chain that ensures that the data stored on the blockchain is valid and has not been altered. Additionally, a consensus mechanism is used to ensure that only valid transactions are added to the blockchain.

Finally, availability is provided by the decentralized nature of the blockchain. The public ledger is spread across multiple nodes in the network, ensuring that the network can continue to function and the data remains accessible even if one node goes offline. This also ensures that there is no single point of failure in the system, making it highly resilient and redundant.

For our project, we not only want to test out the knowledge of these foundations but also integrate some of the most interesting use cases for Blockchains and the type of material that will be found in the game

1. Decentralization: The distributed nature of blockchain technology, where transactions are recorded across multiple nodes on a network, consequently eliminating the need for a central authority or intermediary.

2. Consensus algorithms: The mechanisms by which the network reaches agreement on the state of the blockchain. Common examples include: Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Proof of Authority

3. Smart Contracts: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code and stored within blocks on the network.

4. Distributed Ledger Technology: A digital record-keeping system where multiple copies of a ledger are spread across a network of peers.

5. Cryptography: This is crypto jeopardy, isn't it?

6. Tokenization: The process of creating a digital token, typically on a blockchain, that can represent a variety of assets. Most commonly known as the "NFTs" or as we like to call them "digital monkeys"

7. Privacy and Anonymity: Techniques that protect the identity and transactional data of individuals and organizations using the cryptographic techniques used in blockchain networks

.....and many more, we don't want to spoil the whole game for you.

## How to Run
This project was developed using the Next.js Framework which mainly uses React for the UI and JavaScript for the backend. If you would like to clone this app and test it on your local machine. You can do so by doing the following

1. First, install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>
2. Clone this repository, ensure that you are either logged into the UCBS github account or add your personal account as a collaborator to this project
3. Open terminal, navigate to the project folder that you have cloned.
4. Run the command `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install all modules and dependencies
5. Run the command `npm run dev` to start the web server on `localhost: 3000`
6. Go to your web browser and visit `localhost: 3000`


But again...the game is not finished yet, so you may see some creepy crawly bugs!
