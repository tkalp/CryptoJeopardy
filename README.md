# Crypto Jeopardy

Currently a work in progress...check back soon :)

This project was developed using the Next.js Framework which mainly uses React for the UI and JavaScript for the backend. If you would like to clone this app and test it on your local machine. You can do so by doing the following

1. First, install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>
2. Clone this repository, ensure that you are either logged into the UCBS github account or add your personal account as a collaborator to this project
3. Open terminal, navigate to the project folder that you have cloned.
4. Run the command `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install all modules and dependencies
5. Run the command `npm run dev` to start the web server on `localhost: 3000`
6. Go to your web browser and visit `localhost: 3000`


But again...the game is not finished yet, so you may see some creepy crawly bugs!
